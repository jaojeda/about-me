            <p>
                My name is Jose Ojeda. 
                I'm a coder-in-training. After seven years in the insurance industry I decided it was time to branch out an try new things.
                I moved to Portland in 2016 and havenâ€™t regretted it yet. I live by Woodstock and Sellwood. I'm hoping to find myself in anew carerr in the near future.
